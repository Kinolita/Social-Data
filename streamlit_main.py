"""With the reduction of rainforests and the ozone layer and the increasingly drastic changes in our climate, the world found it important 
to create an international treaty in 2016 called the Paris Agreement. This agreement, which was adopted by 196 countries, aims to limit global 
warming by controlling and reducing greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. While the actions and progress of each country are not required to 
be transparent until 2024, low and zero-carbon solutions and carbon neutrality targets are becoming much more common. But while it appears that 
countries are making an effort to honor the agreements and work towards carbon neutrality, what is the actual progress to date?"""
