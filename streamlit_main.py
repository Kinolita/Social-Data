This agreement, which was adopted by 196 countries, aims to limit global warming by controlling and reducing greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. While the actions and progress of each country are not required to be transparent until 2024, low and zero-carbon solutions and carbon neutrality targets are becoming much more common. But while it appears that countries are making an effort to honor the agreements and work towards carbon neutrality, what is the actual progress to date?')

    Speaking about roller coaster ridesâ€¦ The Friends viewers have also been on a bit of a ride.
    The episode with the lowest overall sentiment was Episode 1 in Season 4: _The one with the Jellyfish_, as you probably remember.
