"""With the reduction of rainforests and the ozone layer and the increasingly drastic changes in our climate, the world found it important 
to create an international treaty in 2016 called the Paris Agreement. This agreement, which was adopted by 196 countries, aims to limit global 
warming by controlling and reducing greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. While the actions and progress of each country are not required to 
be transparent until 2024, low and zero-carbon solutions and carbon neutrality targets are becoming much more common. But while it appears that 
countries are making an effort to honor the agreements and work towards carbon neutrality, what is the actual progress to date?
"""
"""
In Europe and specifically Denmark we hear a lot about climate changes and how we as countries should
strive towards drastically lowering our CO2 emissions. While there is a general concensus in the population -
at least in Denmark - that this is a huge issue, we often are led to believe something else by our politicians.
It can be very hard to fact check what politicians, global companies etc. are saying in regards to the climate,
since their statements are often biased by their subjective goals. Because of that, this article will help
create transparency towards how the actual situation and development have been in regards to lowering CO2 emissions
and how far have we come. We provide the facts, but its up to you to interpret them!"""
